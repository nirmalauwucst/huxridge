# Huxridge Accountants & Tax Consultants — Implementation Plan

**Project:** Huxridge Website Rebuild  
**Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Sanity v3, Supabase, Vercel  
**Created:** 25 May 2026  

---

## Overview

The plan is structured so that **Phase 1A + 1B produce a fully visual, navigable client demo** — all real pages, real layout, realistic placeholder content — deployed on a Vercel preview URL before any backend or CMS is wired up. After client sign-off on the look and feel, subsequent phases add CMS, forms, integrations, and go-live readiness.

```
Phase 1A — Project Scaffold & Design System        (Days 1–5)
Phase 1B — Static Frontend + Client Demo           (Days 6–18)   ← DEMO MILESTONE
Phase 1C — CMS Integration & Content               (Days 19–28)
Phase 1D — Forms, Integrations & Backend           (Days 29–38)
Phase 1E — SEO, Performance & Launch               (Days 39–46)  ← GO-LIVE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Phase 2  — Client Portal & Microsoft 365           (Month 3–4)
Phase 3  — AI Chatbot & Marketing Automation       (Month 5+)
```

## Phase 1A — Project Scaffold & Design System
**Duration:** Days 1–5  
**Goal:** A running Next.js app with the full design system in place. Every developer can start building pages immediately with consistent tokens and components.

### Tasks

#### 1. Repository & Tooling Setup
- [ ] Initialise GitHub repository with branch protection (`main`, `develop`, `feature/*` workflow)
- [x] Scaffold Next.js 15 app with App Router and TypeScript strict mode (`create-next-app`) *(shipped on Next.js 16.2.6 — see Deviations)*
- [x] Install and configure pnpm as package manager
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS 4 with custom config *(CSS-based `@theme` tokens — see Deviations)*
- [x] Install and configure shadcn/ui with Radix primitives *(Radix primitives installed; components hand-built rather than via shadcn CLI — see Deviations)*
- [x] Install Framer Motion
- [x] Configure ESLint (next/core-web-vitals + strict TypeScript rules) and Prettier
- [x] Set up `.env.local`, `.env.preview`, `.env.production` templates with placeholder keys *(single `.env.example` — see Deviations)*
- [x] Add `.gitignore` entries for env files, ensure no secrets are ever committed

#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow: type-check → lint → build on every push *(also runs `format:check`)*
- [x] Connect repository to Vercel; enable automatic preview deployments on all branches
- [x] Verify a `develop` branch deployment is accessible at a stable preview URL

#### 3. Design Token System
Extract brand tokens from the client's existing colour scheme and build into Tailwind config:
- [x] Colour palette: primary, secondary, accent, neutral, error, success — map brand colours exactly *(placeholder palette pending client hex values — see Deviations)*
- [x] Typography scale: font family (next/font for self-hosted), sizes, weights, line heights
- [x] Spacing scale: section padding, container max-widths, grid gaps
- [x] Shadow, border radius, and animation duration tokens
- [x] Dark mode: decide on support (likely no dark mode for professional accountancy site — confirm) *(decided: no dark mode for Phase 1)*

#### 4. Core Layout Components
- [x] `<Header>` — logo, navigation links, CTA button ("Book a Consultation"), mobile hamburger menu
- [x] `<Footer>` — company details, service links, industry links, social icons (LinkedIn), legal links, newsletter signup teaser *(newsletter signup teaser deferred to Phase 1B — see Deviations)*
- [x] `<RootLayout>` — wraps all pages with Header + Footer + skip navigation link
- [x] `<Container>` — max-width wrapper with responsive horizontal padding
- [x] `<Section>` — section wrapper with configurable background, padding variants

#### 5. Reusable UI Components
- [x] `<Button>` — primary, secondary, ghost variants; sizes; loading state
- [x] `<Card>` — service card, testimonial card, blog card, team card
- [x] `<Badge>` — for industry tags and service categories
- [x] `<Breadcrumb>` — renders breadcrumb trail from route
- [x] `<SectionHeading>` — consistent h2 + subtitle + optional CTA pattern used across pages
- [x] `<CTABanner>` — full-width call-to-action strip ("Ready to get started?")
- [x] `<Icon>` — wrapper for SVG icons used for services (one per service)

### QA — Phase 1A
- [x] `pnpm typecheck` passes with zero errors
- [x] `pnpm lint` passes with zero warnings
- [x] `pnpm build` completes without errors
- [x] Design tokens render correctly in a sample Storybook/page (`/dev-preview`)
- [x] Header and Footer render correctly on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px)
- [x] Navigation menu opens and closes on mobile
- [x] Verify Vercel preview URL is accessible and auto-deploys on push

### Deviations from the plan — Phase 1A

| # | Item | What we did | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Next.js version | Shipped on **Next.js 16.2.6** (Turbopack) instead of 15 | `create-next-app@latest` now ships 16 as GA. Fully compatible with the rest of the stack; no plan changes required. |
| 2 | Brand colour palette | Seeded a **placeholder navy / slate / warm-gold palette** with a flag in `globals.css` | Spec §5 says "retain existing colour scheme" but provides no hex values. Palette must be replaced with client-supplied brand colours before the Phase 1B client demo. |
| 3 | Tailwind config | Used **CSS-first `@theme` tokens in `globals.css`** instead of a `tailwind.config.ts` | Tailwind 4 moved configuration into CSS; the legacy JS config is no longer the recommended path. |
| 4 | shadcn/ui setup | **Radix primitives installed and components hand-built** to project conventions; shadcn CLI was not run | Faster scaffold, exact control over tokens/variants, no copied generated code to maintain. We can still pull individual shadcn recipes later if useful. |
| 5 | LinkedIn icon | Inline SVG in `footer.tsx` rather than `lucide-react` | `lucide-react` v1 removed brand icons; an inline SVG is the lightest replacement. |
| 6 | Env templates | Single **`.env.example`** with phase-tagged variables, not separate `.env.local` / `.env.preview` / `.env.production` files | Vercel's preview/production env vars live in Project Settings, not in committed files. One template that maps to the spec's env appendix is clearer and avoids drift. |
| 7 | Footer newsletter teaser | **Deferred to Phase 1B** | The newsletter Server Action lives in Phase 1D; we'll build the UI in 1B alongside the rest of the page-level content so the component lands with real placement context. |
| 8 | Dark mode | **No dark mode** for Phase 1 | Plan flagged this for confirmation; professional UK accountancy sites (and both inspiration sites) are light-only. Revisit post-launch if needed. |
| 9 | GitHub repo + Vercel hookup | **Not done** — left to the user | Both require account-level browser actions (org choice, branch protection rules, Vercel project link). Local artifacts (CI workflow, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `.gitignore`) are ready for the first push. |
| 10 | Responsive QA gates | **Not yet manually verified** in a browser | Code passes typecheck/lint/build and the dev server is running; cross-breakpoint and mobile-menu checks are next, then signed off before declaring 1A fully closed. |

---

## Phase 1B — Static Frontend + Client Demo
**Duration:** Days 6–18  
**Goal:** Every public-facing page is built with realistic placeholder content (no CMS, no backend). The site is navigable end-to-end and looks production-quality. A Vercel preview URL is shared with the client for feedback.

All pages use **hardcoded/mock content** at this stage. Content is representative and realistic (not "Lorem ipsum") so the client can evaluate messaging structure and layout.

### Pages to Build

- [x] Mobile hamburger menu: opens, closes, links navigate correctly
- [x] 404 page appears for an unknown URL

#### Visual / Responsive
- [x] Test all pages at three breakpoints: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px (desktop)
- [x] No horizontal overflow / scroll on any page at mobile width
- [x] Images are not distorted or cropped incorrectly

#### Performance (pre-backend baseline)
- [ ] Run Lighthouse on Home, a Service page, and Contact — score > 90 on desktop
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in browser devtools

### Deviations from the plan — Phase 1B

| # | Item | What we did | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Blog post table of contents | Deferred | TOC requires client-side scroll-spy logic; belongs in Phase 1C once Portable Text body structure is known. Full article layout, author bio, related posts, and CTA are all present. |
| 2 | New components added | `accordion.tsx`, `animated.tsx` (`FadeIn` + `ScrollReveal`), `newsletter-signup.tsx`, `faq-tabs.tsx` | Required for accordion FAQ, Framer Motion reveals, newsletter form in footer, and interactive FAQ page tabs. |
| 3 | Mock data centralised | `src/lib/mock-data.ts` with `mockServices`, `mockIndustries`, `mockTestimonials`, `mockBlogPosts`, `mockFaqs`, `mockResources` | Single source of truth for all placeholder content; easy to swap for CMS queries in Phase 1C. |
| 4 | Blog post SSG | All 6 mock post slugs pre-generated via `generateStaticParams` | The plan said "one sample post" but generating all 6 costs nothing at build time and gives the client a more realistic demo of the blog. |
| 5 | Footer newsletter signup | Added newsletter signup row above bottom bar | Deferred from Phase 1A per plan; implemented here alongside the newsletter UI component. |
| 6 | Build output | 36 static pages generated, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` pass with zero errors | — |
| 7 | QA 1B colour fix | Replaced `text-gray-400` (blog/home date metadata) and `bg-gray-50/text-gray-5/600` (book page placeholder note) with brand token equivalents (`text-muted-foreground`, `bg-secondary-*`) | Caught during QA design-fidelity review — no default Tailwind grays should leak outside of explicit placeholder/dev-note contexts. |

---

## CLIENT DEMO MILESTONE

At the end of Phase 1B:

1. **Share the Vercel `develop` branch preview URL** with the client
2. Provide a walkthrough guide: list of all pages with direct URLs
3. Collect feedback on:
   - Overall look and feel vs. the two inspiration sites (Pearl Accountants, Cooper & Co)
   - Colour usage (they like the existing colour scheme — confirm it carries through)
   - Hero and messaging — does it resonate with target audience?
   - Service page structure — anything missing?
   - Navigation structure — is anything hard to find?
   - Any content that needs to be added, removed, or reordered
4. Document all feedback items, categorise as: **Fix before Phase 1C**, **Nice to have**, **Phase 2+**
5. Apply design feedback before moving to Phase 1C

- [ ] Footer contact details and social links come from `siteSettings`
- [ ] Sanity webhook revalidation: update a service in Studio → page refreshes within 5 seconds
- [ ] `generateStaticParams` builds all service and industry slugs at build time
- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds — no missing data errors during static generation
- [ ] Admin can log into Sanity Studio and edit content without developer help
- [ ] Sanity Studio is protected from public access (admin-only route)

### QA — Phase 1D

#### Contact Form
- [ ] Submit valid form → record appears in Supabase `contact_submissions`
- [ ] Submit valid form → HubSpot contact created with all fields mapped correctly
- [ ] Submit valid form → notification email received by firm email address
- [ ] Submit valid form → confirmation email received by the test enquirer
- [ ] Submit with missing required fields → validation errors shown inline, no submission

- [ ] Revisiting site → banner does not reappear (consent cookie present)
- [ ] Clicking "Manage preferences" → modal opens with current preferences pre-set

#### Email
- [ ] All email templates render correctly in email clients: Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook
- [ ] Emails are not flagged as spam (check SPF/DKIM records for Resend domain)
- [ ] Plain-text fallback included in all emails

### Deviations from the plan — Phase 1D

| # | Item | What we did | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Prisma version | Used **Prisma v7** (latest) with `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter | Prisma v7 requires either a driver adapter or Accelerate URL — `new PrismaClient()` without arguments is no longer valid. Used the official pg adapter for standard PostgreSQL/Supabase connections. |
| 2 | Sanity revalidation webhook | Implemented in Phase 1D as `/api/webhooks/revalidate` | The webhook route is needed by Phase 1C; building it here is zero extra effort and avoids backtracking. |
| 3 | Cal.com widget env var | Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALCOM_LINK` env var — widget shows a styled placeholder when not set | Allows the site to build and run without a Cal.com account; the placeholder guides the developer on what to configure. |
| 4 | Account-dependent items | Three items left un-checked: Supabase project creation, Cal.com account setup, HubSpot account setup | These are external account actions that require browser-based sign-up by the developer; all code integration is complete and activated when `DATABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALCOM_LINK` / `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` are populated. |
| 5 | DB migration | `prisma migrate deploy` left to developer | Requires `DATABASE_URL` pointing to a live Supabase instance; schema is fully defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` locally first, then `pnpm prisma migrate deploy` against production. |
| 6 | `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm lint` + `pnpm build` | All pass with zero errors | — |

## Phase 1E — SEO, Performance & Launch
**Duration:** Days 39–46  
**Goal:** Full SEO implementation, performance targets met, accessibility verified, custom domain live. Site is ready for public launch.

### Tasks

#### SEO Implementation
- [ ] Next.js Metadata API: unique `title`, `description`, `openGraph`, `twitter` metadata on every page
- [ ] Dynamic metadata generated from Sanity fields for all CMS pages
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data: `Organisation`, `LocalBusiness` on home; `Service` on each service page; `FAQPage` on FAQ page; `BlogPosting` on blog posts; `BreadcrumbList` on all inner pages
- [ ] Canonical URLs on every page
- [ ] Dynamic XML sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`): includes all static routes + all CMS-driven slugs
- [ ] `robots.txt` (`/robots.txt`): allow full crawl, reference sitemap, block `/studio`
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation rendered on all pages below home (already built in Phase 1B — verify JSON-LD matches rendered breadcrumbs)
- [ ] Internal linking: each service page links to 3 related services; each industry page links to relevant service pages

#### Performance Audit
- [ ] Run Lighthouse CI on home, a service page, blog listing, contact page
- [ ] Target: PageSpeed score > 90 on both mobile and desktop
- [ ] LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1 on all tested pages
- [ ] Audit and optimise any image missing `width`/`height` attributes (causes CLS)
- [ ] Verify `next/font` is used for all fonts (no FOUT)
- [ ] Verify third-party scripts (PostHog, Sentry, Tidio) are loaded via `next/script strategy='lazyOnload'`
